# Phaser Game - Archived

## ðŸš¨ Important Notice: Project Transitioned to Godot ðŸš¨

Thank you for visiting this repository! This project initially began as a Phaser.js game, but development has now moved to [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). Due to the potential for more advanced features and a streamlined development experience, Godot became the preferred engine for further work on this project.

### Archived Status

- **This repository is archived** and will no longer receive updates or new commits.
- **All future development, updates, and new features** will be available in the new repository created for the Godot version.

### Reason for the Transition

The move to Godot was inspired by:

- Enhanced support for complex game mechanics
- Built-in support for advanced 2D/3D capabilities
- A more intuitive interface for scene and asset management

### New Repository

You can find the latest code, updates, and progress on the game in the new Godot repository here:
[**Godot RPG Repository**](https://github.com/that-devguy/godot-rpg)

### Legacy Code

The code here remains accessible for anyone interested in the initial Phaser.js implementation or for those who want to see the progression from Phaser.js to Godot. However, please note that the Phaser.js version will no longer be maintained.

Thank you for your interest and support in this project!
